# KRUSTY Model Description

*Model link: [KRUSTY](https://github.com/idaholab/virtual_test_bed/microreactors/KRUSTY)*

The Kilopower Reactor Using Stirling Technology (KRUSTY) is a kilopower test reactor which was developed for space exploration missions [1]. This document describes a VTB model that details the work sponsored by DOE NEAMS under the Micro-Reactor Application Drivers area from 2022-2023 [2-4]. The multiphysics model was developed based on the technical work published in the open literature [5-10] and a detailed MCNP6 model included in the ICSBEP HEU-MET-FAST-101 handbook [11]. Approximations have been made in the surrounding areas of the fuel disk to alleviate the burden of creating an equivalent mesh model with good mesh quality and reasonable mesh size. The simplified model will be detailed in Section I of this document.

Multiphysics models were developed for future simulation of the KRUSTY at cold or warm critical states. Its details are included in Section II. This includes Griffin [12] for neutronics, MOOSE Reactor module for the unstructured mesh model [13], BISON for thermos-mechanics and heat transfer [14], and MOOSE MultiApp system for multiphysics coupling [15]. Models and inputs are all explained in detail in Section II and are included in appendices. In addition, to support the Griffin neutronic simulation, Serpent [16] and MC2-3 [17] were also used to provide cross sections in neutronic analysis. The MC2-3 input file is included in Appendix A and the Serpent input file is included in Appendix B with material compositions already disclosed in Appendix A therefore omitted. Section III includes neutronic results obtained from the Griffin stand-alone model compared with the Monte Carlo reference model for model verification. The results obtained from the multiphysics models are also discussed in Section III.
